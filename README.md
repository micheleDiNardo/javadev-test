# Java Developer Test

You have to develop an application that read these two datasets:

- [oscar_age_female.csv](src/main/resources/oscar_age_female.csv)
- and [oscar_age_male.csv](src/main/resources/oscar_age_male.csv)

These files contain list of Academy Awards win by actors/actresses.
Your application has to print the names of the actors/actresses
who have won more than one, in descending order of awards won.

For the same prizes, the younger actors are printed first.
